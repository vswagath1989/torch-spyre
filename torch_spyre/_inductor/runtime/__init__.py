    A class representing a Tensor argument to an OpSpec

    Attributes:
        is_input: Is the Tensor used as an input to the operation?

        dtype: The PyTorch (host) dtype of the tensor elements.
        host_size: The PyTorch (host) size of the Tensor.
        it_dim_map: A mapping between the op's iteration_space and the PyTorch (host) dimensions of the Tensor.
            it_dim_map[d] is an integer that is interpreted as follows:
                -1 indicates the the d-th dimension of ks.iteration_space is a broadcast or reduction dimension for this Tensor.
                A non-negative value is the PyTorch (host) dimension of the Tensor that corresponds to the d-th dimension of ks.iteration_space.
                For non-negative values it must be true that ks.iteration_space[d] == host_size[it_dim_map[d]].
        allocation: If present, the offset in scratchpad memory assigned to the Tensor.
        device_layout: The SpyreTensorLayout describe the device shape of the Tensor.
